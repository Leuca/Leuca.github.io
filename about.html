<h4><strong>About me</strong></h4>
            <br>
                In my twenties from Milan, Italy.
            <br>
                I love electronics, computers, software, cars and, more in general, science.
            <br>
                In my free time I like to work out, code and meditate.
            <br>
                I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
            <br>
            <br>
                After I found out about <a href="https://edx.org" class="link-secondary">edX</a> free courses of Computer Science I decided to take CS50x to improve my coding skills and as a matter of fact this very website is actually my solution of a problem from week 8.
